# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This project is currently in **EARLY ALPHA** stage and is **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE**.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Measures

This project implements the following security measures:

### 1. Secret Scanning with TruffleHog v3

- **Pre-commit hooks**: TruffleHog scans all commits before they are pushed
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Every push and PR is scanned for secrets
- **Full repository scanning**: Both git history and filesystem are scanned
- **Allowlist configuration**: Known non-secret patterns are configured in `.trufflehog.yaml`

### 2. Secure Development Workflow

- Pre-commit hooks for security scanning
- Automated dependency updates
- Code signing for releases (planned)
- Security vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

### 3. Safe Defaults

- Protection mode is default (only kills processes when RAM is critical)
- Extensive whitelist of system-critical processes
- Requires explicit sudo/root permissions
- Comprehensive logging of all actions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**⚠️ REMINDER**: This software is in ALPHA stage. Use at your own risk.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainer at: [security contact will be added]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 48 hours
  - High: Within 7 days
  - Medium: Within 30 days
  - Low: Next release

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Always run with least privilege**
   - Use protection mode (default) in production
   - Only use hunting mode in development/testing

2. **Monitor the logs**
   - Check `~/memory_leak_killer.log` regularly
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity

3. **Keep the software updated**
   - Security fixes will be released promptly
   - Subscribe to release notifications

4. **Verify downloads**
   - Always download from official sources
   - Verify checksums when available

## Known Security Considerations

1. **Root Access Required**: The tool requires root access to kill processes, which is a significant security consideration
2. **Process Killing**: The tool can terminate any non-whitelisted process, which could be disruptive
3. **Docker Integration**: When enabled, can stop Docker containers

## Development Security

All contributors must:

1. Use pre-commit hooks (automatically installed)
2. Pass all security scans before merging
3. Follow secure coding practices
4. Never commit secrets or credentials

## Security Tools Used

- **TruffleHog v3**: Secret scanning
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Ruff**: Security-focused Python linting
- **GitHub Security Features**: Dependabot, CodeQL (planned)

## Compliance

This project aims to follow:

- OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- Python Security Best Practices
- macOS Security Guidelines

**Remember**: This is ALPHA software. Always test thoroughly in a safe environment before any production use.
